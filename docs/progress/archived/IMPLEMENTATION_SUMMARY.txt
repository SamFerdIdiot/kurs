CONTROLS SUMMARY
-----------------

Main Menu: Up/Down/Enter/Esc
Character Creation: Left/Right/Enter/Esc
Driving: Left/Right/A/D (movement), Space (overlay), Esc/I/T/M/O (shortcuts)
Town: Left/Right/Enter/E/Esc
Motel: R/I/M/S/Enter/Esc

Inventory: Arrow keys/Enter/U/D/I/Esc
Pause: Up/Down/Enter/Esc
Game Over: Left/Right/Enter/Esc

NEXT STEPS FOR DEVELOPMENT
---------------------------

1. Replace rectangle placeholders with actual sprites/textures
2. Add text labels to all UI elements
3. Implement game logic following TODO comments
4. Create resource management system
5. Add audio system (music and sound effects)
6. Implement save/load functionality
7. Create dialogue tree system
8. Develop inventory item system
9. Add animation system
10. Implement driving physics

CONCLUSION
-----------

This code skeleton provides a solid, well-architected foundation for 
developing the full Road Trip Adventure RPG game. All requirements have 
been met, the code is clean and documented, and the structure is ready 
for extension and development.

The skeleton demonstrates:
- Clean architecture with scene-based design
- Proper separation of concerns
- Extensible framework
- Comprehensive documentation
- Production-ready code structure

Ready for development! 🚗💨
